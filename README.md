# Category Queue

A simple plugin that allows you to automatically queue all new topics (**not posts! Just topics**) in selected categories

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-category-queue

## Disclaimer

This plugin was created to serve one forum - [wieloswiat.pl](https://wieloswiat.pl) and I can't guarantee if it will work on your NodeBB installation with different plugins etc. It should, but don't blame me if it doesn't.
